# Audiobook-Generation
Using Reddit API and Genny API , creating an audibook generating app
1) Using requests to acccess Reddit API getting data from r/nosleep , getting HORROR STORIES from the subreddit.
2) Adding it into a file.txt folder.
3) Then using  genny api to access the folder and convert the first 500 character(as its the limit for this API) into an audiobook voiceover.

   Further development:
   Creating an app to host these audiobooks.
   Using CHATGPT's API to convert these stories into a shorter version of themselves.
